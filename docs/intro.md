# ‚ôªÔ∏è Community Extrusion and Compression Molding Machines     

- Community extrusion and compression molding machines are modified versions of traditional extrusion and compression molding machines that usually use by industries to make plastic products from virgin or waste plastics, Only a few industries are working on the recycling of the plastic wastes and converts them into useful products because used plastic can damage their machines and reduce the production rates.     
- So, we built extrusion and compression molding machines that can be used by any local community or small to medium level industries to recycle plastic wastes and can convert them into useful products.         
- Our project is mostly derived from [__One Army or Precious Plastic__](https://www.onearmy.earth/) Community.      

# üíµ Support/Funding for this project       

- This project is made by the fund of [__ITM VOCATIONAL UNIVERSITY, GUJARAT, INDIA__](https://www.itm.ac.in/) under the student startup and innovation policy (SSIP) by Gujarat government. Find more details about this policy [here](http://www.ssipgujarat.in/).     
- I, __Dev Soni__ and my colleague __Rutvik Pradhan__ availed the funding amount of __83,899 INR__ ‚âà __1,150 USD__, We finished the project under budget, expected budget was 1,20,000 INR.      
- Guides of the project were __JaiminKumar Bhatt__ for mechanics and __Mayur Chavla__ for electrical stuff.
